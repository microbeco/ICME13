MicrobEco is a non-profit scientific organization dedicated to the advancement of scientific research and know-how in the field of microbiology and ecology. MICROBECO's mission is to promote the understanding and appreciation of microbes, to disseminate knowledge, strengthen collaboration, create and provide opportunities to learn about, discuss and challenge frontier issues in microbial ecology and to support the development of new technologies and applications that can benefit society. We connect scientists and we educate future generations to know and to do not fear microbes.

## ICME 13 - Rome

The course "Crash course on Nanopore sequencing for microbial ecology" corresponds to the 13th edition of the ICME- International course in microbial ecology, which annually gathers selected students to receive theoretical and practical training on one or more techniques in microbial ecology. From 11 to 14 March 2024, 25 PhD students and early career researchers will have practical experience in sequencing using Nanopore technology (MinIon) and performing bioinformatic analysis of Nanopore sequencing data. As in the tradition of ICME, The entire course is designed to bring together beginners and experts, and to create a strong collaboration between colleagues that extends beyond the days of the course.


The course is held at the laboratory of CNR-IRSA Institute of Water Research Roma Montelibretti.
