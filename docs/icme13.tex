\section{ICME 13 - Rome}\label{icme-13---rome}}

The course ``Crash course on Nanopore sequencing for microbial ecology'' corresponds to the 13th edition of the ICME- International course in microbial ecology, which annually gathers selected students to receive theoretical and practical training on one or more techniques in microbial ecology. From 11 to 14 March 2024, 25 PhD students and early career researchers will have practical experience in sequencing using Nanopore technology (MinIon) and performing bioinformatic analysis of Nanopore sequencing data. As in the tradition of ICME, The entire course is designed to bring together beginners and experts, and to create a strong collaboration between colleagues that extends beyond the days of the course.

The course is held at the laboratory of CNR-IRSA Institute of Water Research Roma Montelibretti.

\textbf{MacOS/Linux:} Launch terminal on your machine.

\textbf{Windows users options:}
\textbf{Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)} --\textgreater{} It creates an Ubuntu terminal environment where you can code just like from a linux Ubuntu terminal. This is useful for the course as well as for practice working in bash. \href{https://ubuntu.com/wsl}{from ubuntu website} and \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install}{from the windows website}

\textbf{SSH client} --\textgreater{} Windows: {[}MobaXterm{]}(~\url{https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html} . This is a very basic ssh client, meaning, it will allow you to connect to the server and it will serve as a terminal for the course.

If you are already using Visual Studio, it needs one ssh~\href{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh}{extension}~plugin to serve as a ssh.

\textbf{Git for windows} --\textgreater{} I am not sure this can be used as a ssh but, in regards to this course, it is also useful to practice coding on the terminal.

Very last-minute resource --\textgreater{} launch \href{https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg\&mem=192}{this terminal emulator} in a new window.

\hypertarget{working-with-the-command-line}{%
\section{Working with the command line}\label{working-with-the-command-line}}

Most of the activities of the bioinformatic section of this workshop will be done using the Unix command line (Unix shell).\\
It is therefore highly recommended to have at least a basic grasp of how to get around in the Unix shell.\\
We will now dedicate one hour or so to follow some basic to learn (or refresh) the basics of the Unix shell.

\begin{quote}
{[}!question{]} What is the UNIX SHELL? What is Bash?

\begin{quote}
{[}!todo{]} The shell is a program that enables us to send commands to the computer and receive output. It is also referred to as the terminal or command line. Some computers include a default Unix Shell program.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
{[}!todo{]} The most popular Unix shell is Bash, Bash is a shell and a command language.
\end{quote}

For a \textbf{Mac} computer running macOS Mojave or earlier releases, the default Unix Shell is Bash.

For a \textbf{Mac} computer running macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh. Your default shell is available via the Terminal program within your Utilities folder.

The default Unix Shell for \textbf{Linux} operating systems is usually Bash.

\section{Playing around with basic UNIX commands}\label{playing-around-with-basic-unix-commands}}

\hypertarget{some-notes}{%
\subsection{Some notes!}\label{some-notes}}

These commands:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ unix\_shell}
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ unix\_shell}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\ldots are commands you need to type in the shell.
Each line is a command.
Commands have to be typed in a single line, one at a time.
After each command, hit ``Enter'' to execute it.

Things starting with a hashtag:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# This is a comment and is ignored by the shell}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\ldots are comments embedded in the code to give instructions to the user.
Anything in a line starting with a \texttt{\#} is ignored by the shell.

Different commands might expect different syntaxes and different types of arguments. Some times the order matters, some times it doesn't! The best way to check how to run a command is by taking a look at its manual with the command \texttt{man} or to the --help for a shorter version of it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{man}\NormalTok{ mkdir}

\CommentTok{\# You can scroll down by hitting the space bar}
\CommentTok{\# To quit, hit "q"}

\FunctionTok{mkdir} \AttributeTok{{-}h}

\CommentTok{\# did it work?}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{creating-and-navigating-directories}{%
\subsection{Creating and navigating directories}\label{creating-and-navigating-directories}}

First let's see where we are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{pwd}  \CommentTok{\# print working directory}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Are there any files here? Let's list the contents of the folder:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ls}

\CommentTok{\# or }

\ExtensionTok{ll}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's now create a new folder called \texttt{unix\_shell}. In addition to the command (\texttt{mkdir}), we are now passing a term (also known as an argument) which, in this case, is the name of the folder we want to create:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ unix\_shell}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Has anything changed? How to list the contents of the folder again?

HINT (CLICK TO EXPAND)

\begin{quote}
ls
\end{quote}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

And now let's enter the \texttt{unix\_shell} folder:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ unix\_shell}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Did it work? Where are we now?

HINT

\begin{quote}
pwd
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{creating-a-new-file}{%
\subsection{Creating a new file}\label{creating-a-new-file}}

Let's create a new file called \texttt{myfile.txt} by launching the text editor \texttt{nano}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{nano}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now inside the nano screen:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write some text
\item
  Exit the ``writing mode'' with ctrl+x
  nano
\item
  To save the file, type \textbf{y} and hit ``Enter''
\item
  Confirm the name of the file and hit ``Enter''
\end{enumerate}

List the contents of the folder. Can you see the file we have just created?

\hypertarget{copying-renaming-moving-and-deleting-files}{%
\subsection{Copying, renaming, moving and deleting files}\label{copying-renaming-moving-and-deleting-files}}

First let's create a new folder called \texttt{myfolder}. Do you remember how to do this?

HINT

\begin{quote}
mkdir myfolder
\end{quote}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

And now let's make a copy of \texttt{myfile.txt}. Here, the command \texttt{cp} expects two arguments, and the order of these arguments matter. The first is the name of the file we want to copy, and the second is the name of the new file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt newfile.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

List the contents of the folder. Do you see the new file there?

Now let's say we want to copy a file and put it inside a folder. In this case, we give the name of the folder as the second argument to \texttt{cp}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt myfolder }

\CommentTok{\# while typing myfold.. try using the TAB to predict the name of the folder!}

\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt myfolder/  }\CommentTok{\# it will recognise it is a directory and add the / at the end.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

List the contents of \texttt{myfolder}. Is \texttt{myfile.txt} there?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ myfolder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can also copy the file to another folder and give it a different name, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt myfolder/copy\_of\_myfile.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

List the contents of \texttt{myfolder} again. Do you see two files there?

Instead of copying, we can move files around with the command \texttt{mv}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ newfile.txt myfolder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's list the contents of the folders. Where did \texttt{newfile.txt} go?

We can also use the command \texttt{mv} to rename files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt myfile\_renamed.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

List the contents of the folder again. What happened to \texttt{myfile.txt}?

Now, let's say we want to move things from inside \texttt{myfolder} to the current directory. Can you see what the dot (\texttt{.}) is doing in the command below? Let's try:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ myfolder/newfile.txt .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's list the contents of the folders. The file \texttt{newfile.txt} was inside \texttt{myfolder} before, where is it now?

The same operation can be done in a different way. In the commands below, can you see what the two dots (\texttt{.}) are doing? Let's try:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# First we go inside the folder}
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ myfolder}

\CommentTok{\# Then we move the file one level up}
\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ myfile.txt ..}

\CommentTok{\# And then we go back one level}
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ..}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's list the contents of the folders. The file \texttt{myfile.txt} was inside \texttt{myfolder} before, where is it now?

To remove files :

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{ newfile.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's list the contents of the folder. What happened to \texttt{newfile.txt}?

And now let's delete \texttt{myfolder}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{ myfolder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It didn't work did it? An error message came up, what does it mean?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{rm:}\NormalTok{ cannot remove ‘myfolder’: Is a directory}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To delete a folder we have to modify the command further by adding the flag (\texttt{-r}). Flags are used to pass additional options to the commands:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm} \AttributeTok{{-}r}\NormalTok{ myfolder}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's list the contents of the folder. What happened to \texttt{myfolder}?

\begin{quote}
{[}!warning{]}
\textbf{In Bash, If you remove the wrong file/directory, it is gone forever!! (no recycle bin!)}
\textbf{aka BE CAREFUL!!}
\end{quote}
