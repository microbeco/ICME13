MICROBECO’s mission is to promote the understanding and appreciation of microbes, to disseminate knowledge, strengthen collaboration, create and provide opportunities to learn about, discuss and challenge frontier issues in microbial ecology and to support the development of new technologies and applications that can benefit society. We connect scientists and we educate future generations to know and to do not fear microbes. 1.1 ICME 13 - Rome The course “Crash course on Nanopore sequencing for microbial ecology” corresponds to the 13th edition of the ICME- International course in microbial ecology, which annually gathers selected students to receive theoretical and practical training on one or more techniques in microbial ecology. From 11 to 14 March 2024, 25 PhD students and early career researchers will have practical experience in sequencing using Nanopore technology (MinIon) and performing bioinformatic analysis of Nanopore sequencing data. As in the tradition of ICME, The entire course is designed to bring together beginners and experts, and to create a strong collaboration between colleagues that extends beyond the days of the course. The course is held at the laboratory of CNR-IRSA Institute of Water Research Roma Montelibretti.

Windows users options: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) –&gt; It creates an Ubuntu terminal environment where you can code just like from a linux Ubuntu terminal. This is useful for the course as well as for practice working in bash. from ubuntu website and from the windows website SSH client –&gt; Windows: [MobaXterm]( https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html . This is a very basic ssh client, meaning, it will allow you to connect to the server and it will serve as a terminal for the course. If you are already using Visual Studio, it needs one ssh extension plugin to serve as a ssh. Git for windows –&gt; I am not sure this can be used as a ssh but, in regards to this course, it is also useful to practice coding on the terminal. Very last-minute resource –&gt; launch this terminal emulator in a new window. 2.2 Working with the command line Most of the activities of the bioinformatic section of this workshop will be done using the Unix command line (Unix shell). It is therefore highly recommended to have at least a basic grasp of how to get around in the Unix shell. We will now dedicate one hour or so to follow some basic to learn (or refresh) the basics of the Unix shell. [!question] What is the UNIX SHELL? What is Bash? [!todo] The shell is a program that enables us to send commands to the computer and receive output. It is also referred to as the terminal or command line. Some computers include a default Unix Shell program. [!todo] The most popular Unix shell is Bash, Bash is a shell and a command language. For a Mac computer running macOS Mojave or earlier releases, the default Unix Shell is Bash. For a Mac computer running macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh. Your default shell is available via the Terminal program within your Utilities folder. The default Unix Shell for Linux operating systems is usually Bash. 2.3 Playing around with basic UNIX commands 2.3.1 Some notes! These commands: mkdir unix_shell cd unix_shell …are commands you need to type in the shell. Each line is a command. Commands have to be typed in a single line, one at a time. After each command, hit “Enter” to execute it. Things starting with a hashtag: # This is a comment and is ignored by the shell …are comments embedded in the code to give instructions to the user. Anything in a line starting with a # is ignored by the shell. Different commands might expect different syntaxes and different types of arguments. Some times the order matters, some times it doesn’t! The best way to check how to run a command is by taking a look at its manual with the command man or to the –help for a shorter version of it: man mkdir # You can scroll down by hitting the space bar # To quit, hit &quot;q&quot; mkdir -h # did it work? 2.3.2 Creating and navigating directories First let’s see where we are: pwd # print working directory Are there any files here? Let’s list the contents of the folder: ls # or ll Let’s now create a new folder called unix_shell. In addition to the command (mkdir), we are now passing a term (also known as an argument) which, in this case, is the name of the folder we want to create: mkdir unix_shell Has anything changed? How to list the contents of the folder again? HINT (CLICK TO EXPAND) ls And now let’s enter the unix_shell folder: cd unix_shell Did it work? Where are we now? HINT pwd 2.3.3 Creating a new file Let’s create a new file called myfile.txt by launching the text editor nano: nano myfile.txt Now inside the nano screen: Write some text Exit the “writing mode” with ctrl+x nano To save the file, type y and hit “Enter” Confirm the name of the file and hit “Enter” List the contents of the folder. Can you see the file we have just created? 2.3.4 Copying, renaming, moving and deleting files First let’s create a new folder called myfolder. Do you remember how to do this? HINT mkdir myfolder And now let’s make a copy of myfile.txt. Here, the command cp expects two arguments, and the order of these arguments matter. The first is the name of the file we want to copy, and the second is the name of the new file: cp myfile.txt newfile.txt List the contents of the folder. Do you see the new file there? Now let’s say we want to copy a file and put it inside a folder. In this case, we give the name of the folder as the second argument to cp: cp myfile.txt myfolder # while typing myfold.. try using the TAB to predict the name of the folder! cp myfile.txt myfolder/ # it will recognise it is a directory and add the / at the end. List the contents of myfolder. Is myfile.txt there? ls myfolder We can also copy the file to another folder and give it a different name, like this: cp myfile.txt myfolder/copy_of_myfile.txt List the contents of myfolder again. Do you see two files there? Instead of copying, we can move files around with the command mv: mv newfile.txt myfolder Let’s list the contents of the folders. Where did newfile.txt go? We can also use the command mv to rename files: mv myfile.txt myfile_renamed.txt List the contents of the folder again. What happened to myfile.txt? Now, let’s say we want to move things from inside myfolder to the current directory. Can you see what the dot (.) is doing in the command below? Let’s try: mv myfolder/newfile.txt . Let’s list the contents of the folders. The file newfile.txt was inside myfolder before, where is it now? The same operation can be done in a different way. In the commands below, can you see what the two dots (.) are doing? Let’s try: # First we go inside the folder cd myfolder # Then we move the file one level up mv myfile.txt .. # And then we go back one level cd .. Let’s list the contents of the folders. The file myfile.txt was inside myfolder before, where is it now? To remove files : rm newfile.txt Let’s list the contents of the folder. What happened to newfile.txt? And now let’s delete myfolder: rm myfolder It didn’t work did it? An error message came up, what does it mean? rm: cannot remove ‘myfolder’: Is a directory To delete a folder we have to modify the command further by adding the flag (-r). Flags are used to pass additional options to the commands: rm -r myfolder Let’s list the contents of the folder. What happened to myfolder? [!warning] In Bash, If you remove the wrong file/directory, it is gone forever!! (no recycle bin!) aka BE CAREFUL!! "],["s-analysis.html", "3 16s Analysis 3.1 Commands and features that we will use in our practice 3.2 Package Manager 3.3 Base Calling 3.4 Filtering and Trimming 3.5 Subsetting 3.6 Taxonomic Assignment", " 3 16s Analysis In this tutorial we are going to see/use different commands and tools to perform the 16s analysis on long reads NanoPore. However, the practical analysis will cover only some of these steps as data has been prepared in advance due to their computation and time consuming limits. This guide has been created with the purpose of a practical crush course and it is not intended as a complete reference but rather as a beginners pipeline to analyze NanoPore generated data. 3.1 Commands and features that we will use in our practice 3.1.1 touch Create a new empty file. Example: touch prova.txt 3.1.2 echo The echo command is a built-in Linux feature that prints out arguments as the standard output. echo is commonly used to display text strings or command results as messages. Example: echo \"Hello World\" 3.1.3 cat Concatenate or print the contents of a file Example: cat prova.txt 3.1.4 $ Append $ to the variable name to access the variable value. Example: var=&quot;Hello World&quot; echo $var Output: Hello World 3.1.5 chmod Change the permissions of a file or directory and make it executable. use the “chmod +x” command on a system file to give permission to all users to execute it. use the “chmod u+x” for made the file executable for your user. Example: chmod u+x s01_filtering.sh 3.1.6 basename It removes the path from a file string, providing only its filename and trailing suffix from given file names. Example: basename /path/to/filename.txt Output: filename.txt 3.1.7 Create a shell scripts Sometime you don’t need to run a command at a time, we can pre-think, organize series of actions (a program) that you can then execute within Bash. For example we can write a shell script that runs a series of commands and we can run the script from the terminal to execute all the steps that we have integrated in the script. For example, lets assume that we want to visualize the first four reads from a FASTQ and redirect to a file. For this task we are going to create an empty file and write in it the following text: #!/bin/bash cat /SERVER/16s_data/mysample.FASTQ | head -n 4 &gt; first_read.fastq var=&quot;Hello World&quot; echo $var Now we give the ‘executable’ permission to our script in order to be executed: chmod u+x myscript.sh Now we execute our script: ./myscript.sh The first row must be #!/bin/bash to allows the shell to interpret your code with bash The symbol | is the PIPE, it lets you connect actions: the output of a command is the input of the next command The command head allows to print a specified number of rows from an input. Sometime different actions cannot be linked with a PIPE, in this case we use to write the series of actions in each line, as we did in the last two rows of our scripts. 3.2 Package Manager 3.2.1 Conda Conda is a powerful command line tool for package and environment management that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html Within conda, you can create, export, list, remove, and update environments that have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them. Switching or moving between environments is called activating the environment. You can also share an environment file. 3.2.2 Mamba (Recommended) Mamba is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++, so it is faster and more convenient due to its faster dependencies solving. https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html 3.2.2.1 Creating a conda/mamba env To create an environment: conda create -n myenv To activate a created environment: conda activate myenv 3.2.2.2 Installing tools Most of the bioinformatics packages can be searched in Bioconda at this link https://bioconda.github.io, but also in conda-forge channel and then we can install them by executing mamba install -c bioconda -c conda-forge nanofilt For our practical analysis, conda environments have already been created. The following environment were created: mamba activate /home/irsa/miniconda3/envs/ONTpp mamba activate /home/irsa/miniconda3/envs/emu 3.3 Base Calling Base calling is the process of translating the electronic raw signal of the sequencer into bases, i.e., ATCG and converting the raw files (FAST5) to a FASTQ files (human-readable), which contains the nucleotide sequences of the reads. Raw data are huge in terms of storage, and since basecalling is computationally and time demanding, the fastq files are already provided. However, to perform this step we suggest to use one of the two following tools: 3.3.1 Guppy https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/Guppy-protocol/v/gpb_2003_v1_revax_14dec2018/guppy-software-overview Guppy usage: guppy_basecaller \\ --num_callers 4 \\ --cpu_threads_per_caller 64 \\ --input_path \\ --save_path \\ --flowcell FLO-MIN106 \\ --kit SQK-RBK004s As we can see from the command line this tool requires the flowcell model and eventually barcoding kit information. 3.3.2 Dorado Recently released by Nanopore, Dorado is a high-performance, easy-to-use, open source basecaller for Oxford Nanopore reads, with the options of super, high and low, accuracy. https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado First download the flowcell model kit (You need to know which flowcell was used): dorado download --model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v4.1.0 Dorado usage: dorado basecaller \\ -b 36 \\ --device cpu \\ --emit-fastq mysample.FAST5 3.4 Filtering and Trimming The fastq file containing the 16S sequence need to be filtered based on quality and/or read length, and optional trimmed after passing filter 3.4.1 NanoFilt NanoFilt - filtering and trimming of long read sequencing data https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt Requirement To execute this tool, you need to activate the conda environment mamba activate /home/irsa/miniconda3/envs/ONTpp STEP TIPS: Your input data are available in the following path: /SERVER/16s_data/ Your task should be to use NanoFilt on each fastq file, using the following options: --length LENGTH Filter on a minimum read length --maxlength MAXLENGTH Filter on a maximum read length --quality QUALITY Filter on a minimum average read quality score Create the folder for your output files (to use in your script) To perform this step you should create a script (Recommended name: s01_nanofilt.sh), and give it permission to be executed: chmod u+x s01_nanofilt.sh Execute your script as follow: ./s01_nanofilt.sh Look at the results [SPOILER] - Scripts that we will use We create an empty file called s01_nanofilt.sh touch s01_nanofilt.sh We can write our actions in the scripts as follows: #!/bin/bash for i in /SERVER/16s_data/*fastq do f=$(basename &quot;$i&quot; .fastq) echo &quot;$f&quot; echo &quot;$i&quot; cat $i | NanoFilt -q 9 -l 1200 --maxlength 1800 &gt; /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s01/&quot;$f&quot;-nf.fastq done Create output directory for this script (Change irsa with your utenteX name) mkdir -p /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s01/ Change its permission: chmod u+x s01_nanofilt.sh Execute it: ./s01_nanofilt.sh 3.5 Subsetting We are going to reduce the number of reads in order to use less resources for our practical analysis. It is important to note that this step is not part of a common pipeline. 3.5.1 BBMAP Tools BBMap - short read aligner for DNA/RNAseq, and other bioinformatic tools, including BBMap. https://github.com/BioInfoTools/BBMap From this step, we use a script provided by BBMAP tools collection, called: reformat.sh, which reformats reads to change ASCII quality encoding, interleaving, file format, or compression format. Requirement To execute this tool, you need to activate the conda environment: mamba activate /home/irsa/miniconda3/envs/ONTpp STEP TIPS: Your input data should be available from the output folder of the previous step Your task should be to use reformat.sh on each output files obtained from the previous step, using the following options: in=&lt;file&gt; Input file out=&lt;outfile&gt; Ouput file samplereadstarget=10000 Exact number of OUTPUT reads (or pairs) desired. Create the folder for your output files (to use in your script) To perform this step you should create a script (Recommended name: s02_subsampling.sh), and give it permission to be executed: chmod u+x s02_subsampling.sh Execute your script as follow: ./s02_subsampling.sh Look at the results [SPOILER] - Scripts that we will use We create an empty file called s02_subsampling.sh touch s02_subsampling.sh We can write our actions in the scripts as follows: #!/bin/bash # Create output directory for this script mkdir -p /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s02/ for i in /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s01/*-nf.fastq do f=$(basename &quot;$i&quot; -nf.fastq) echo &quot;$f&quot; echo &quot;$i&quot; reformat.sh in=&quot;$i&quot; out=/home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s02/&quot;$f&quot;-ss-nf.fastq samplereadstarget=10000 done Create output directory for this script (Change irsa with your utenteX name) mkdir -p /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s02/ Change its permission: chmod u+x s02_subsampling.sh 3.6 Taxonomic Assignment Last step, the sequences are compared to a reference database for taxonomic assignment and a relative abundance estimator for 16S genomic sequences. 3.6.1 EMU Emu - species-level taxonomic abundance for full-length 16S reads. This tool use a method optimized for error-prone full-length reads. However, it can be used for short-reads. https://github.com/treangenlab/emu To perform this annotation, we need a reference database that contains all the taxonomic information, which was already been downloaded in the following path: /SERVER/emu_database Requirement To execute this tool, you need to activate the conda environment: mamba activate /home/irsa/miniconda3/envs/emu STEP TIPS: Your input data should be available from the previous step Your task should be to use emu abundance on each output files obtained from the previous step, using the following options: --type map-ont denote sequencer [short-read:sr, Pac-Bio:map-pb, ONT:map-ont] --keep-counts include estimated read counts for each species in output --output-dir &lt;output_dir&gt; directory for output results (to be created in advance) --output-basename &lt;basename_files&gt; basename of all output files saved in output-dir; default utilizes basename from input file(s) Create the folder for your output files (to use in your script) To perform this step you should create a script (Recommended name: s03_abundance.sh), and give it permission to be executed: chmod u+x s03_abundance.sh Specify the path of the EMU database with the following line as an action: export EMU_DATABASE_DIR=/SERVER/emu_database Last line of your script, should be an action that performs the command emu combine-outputs to create a single table containing all Emu output relative abundances in a single directory. Note this function will select all the .tsv files in the provided directory that contain ‘rel-abundance’ in the filename. Use the following options in your emu combine-outputs command: --counts output estimated counts rather than relative abundance percentage in combined table. Only includes Emu relative abundance outputs that already have ‘estimated counts’ tax_id to get results for the most specific taxa level Execute your script as follow: ./s03_abundance.sh Look at the results [SPOILER] - Scripts that we will use We create an empty file called s03_abundance.sh touch s03_abundance.sh We can write our actions in the scripts as follows: #!/bin/bash # mamba activate /home/irsa/miniconda3/envs/emu export EMU_DATABASE_DIR=/SERVER/emu_database for i in /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s02/*-ss-nf.fastq do f=$(basename &quot;$i&quot; -ss-nf.fastq) echo &quot;$f&quot; echo &quot;$i&quot; emu abundance &quot;$i&quot; --type map-ont --output-basename &quot;$f&quot; --keep-counts --output-dir /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s03/ --threads 4 done emu combine-outputs --counts /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s03/ tax_id Create output directory for this script (Change irsa with your utenteX name) mkdir -p /home/irsa/analisi_16s/output_s03/ Change its permission: chmod u+x s03_abundance.sh "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
